            Do you have a backlog of depositions to attend? Do you have a shortage of skilled professionals to transcribe your depositions in-house? Due to the nature of the trial, several experienced court reporters interact with witnesses and observers who may not be able to attend in person. Transcripts of these depositions must be error-free and include only material that can be verified, with no misunderstandings or errors.
