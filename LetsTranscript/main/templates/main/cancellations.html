        <h2>Our Cancellation Policy</h2>
    </div>
    <h4 class="fw-bold">When is a customer eligible for a refund? </h4>
    <p>
        The transcription or translation order cannot be cancelled once the process has been started. <br><br>
        Once the transcription or translation has been delivered, you can opt for free re-review if you find the accuracy of the transcription is as promised by the website. <br><br>
        However, we offer refunds if the guaranteed transcription or translation accuracy for your order is not fullfilled. <br><br>
        The refund amount, however, depends on the accuracy of the transcription or translation. If the accuracy of transcription or translation is less than 80%, then 40% of the total amount paid for this transaction will be refunded, and lesser as the accuracy decreases. <br><br>
        However, if the accuracy is less than 50%, then the full amount will be refunded. <br><br>
        The accuracy of transcription is calculated on the audible voices in the audio/video data provided by the customer. <br><br>
        If more than 25% of the total audio/video data is not audible then the refund is not applicable on the transcription or translation service opted for the respective audio/video data. <br><br>
        The refund is processed in 3 business days. <br><br>
        The refund amount is either added to letstranscript wallet or transferred to original mode of payment during the transaction.
