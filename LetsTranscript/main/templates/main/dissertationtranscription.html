            <h2 class="h4 bold">For those who are unfamiliar with the term "dissertation transcription", what is it?</h2>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                A dissertation is a substantial written work on a specific subject within a certain field that is submitted to a committee for approval. Dissertations are often needed among university students who want to pursue degree studies such as an M.Phil., Ph.D., or MBA, among other things. Standard digital audio/video recorders or tape recorders are often used by students to capture their data, ideas, and study as well as to conduct and evaluate their research. Following the completion of research, the process of converting notes, interviews, or seminars from speech to text is known as dissertation transcription.
            </p>
            <ol class="uyshjgdiku">
                <li>For dissertation transcription, we have the fastest turnaround time as compared to our competitors (12-24 hours)</li>
                <li>In order to meet the requirements of your university, we will provide you with a dissertation that is produced in the format prescribed required by your institution.</li>
                <li>It is easy to work with our transcribers because they are accessible, cooperative and professional.</li>
                <li>We have a staff of highly competent and skilled dissertation transcriptionists.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="h4 bold">Is there a specific transcription format you require?</h2>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                Transcription services come in many different types. It all depends on what are your dissertation requirements. It's better to have more than one choice.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h4 bold">Full Verbatim</h2>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                Each and every detail is captured in these transcripts, which are available here. Their recordings catch not only the main body of what is said, but also the breaks and slightest utters like ‘ummms’ ‘ooohs’ ‘ahs’ ‘y'knows’ and many other grammatical quirks that are characteristic of human speech. There is a possibility that they are necessary for qualitative context.... Alternatively, they might be seen as unneeded diversions. According to your requirements, you may have them included as well.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h4 bold">Verbatim</h2>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                The term "intelligent verbatim" refers to verbatim that has been stripped of any extraneous information. All of the speech involuntary movements have been eliminated, and you are left with merely what has been stated. As far as interview questions go, it's the simplest to read and the best option.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h4 bold">Quick and accurate transcriptions. You have our word on it. 100% Trust Guaranteed.</h2>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                Once again, the whole campus is buzzing with academic activity, there is just enough going and on that finding a transcription service provider will be close to impossible. However, even if you have a packed calendar, you may not have to look for a transcription service to transcribe your interviews.
            </p>
            <p class="uyshjgdiku">
                There's nothing worse than paying a transcription company for a transcript that doesn't satisfy your standards.
