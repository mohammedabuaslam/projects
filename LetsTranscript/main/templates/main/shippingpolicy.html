    <p>
        Lets Transcript does not deal with any form of physical shipment of products. When a user places an order, the virtual shipping details are sent to the customer on the registered email.
        When the order is processed, an email is sent to the user with order/shipping details with instructions from where the user can download the order invoice and services related to the order.
