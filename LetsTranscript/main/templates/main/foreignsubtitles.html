                The subtitling technique follows strict and precise rules: the subtitle, for example, cannot occupy more than two lines on the screen, it must contain a certain number of characters and time spent on the screen must be very precise, to keep up with the dialogue and at the same time be easily readable by the public. The correct transposition of the oral message in written form, therefore, requires specific skills and long experience gained in the field. <br><br>
