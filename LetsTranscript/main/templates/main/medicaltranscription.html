    <p class="uyshjgdiku">
        Special knowledge is required for the medical and pharmaceutical sectors. In addition to conscientiousness and precision, basic medical knowledge is required for both expressions and terminology. A high-quality medical transcription can therefore only be carried out by an employee who is not only perfect in the field but who also has a command of the very specific terminology.
    </p>

    <p class="uyshjgdiku">
        The transcription of a medical recording should be done by a specialist because the use of language, nuances of pharmaceutical products, or descriptions of illnesses, must be taken into account.
